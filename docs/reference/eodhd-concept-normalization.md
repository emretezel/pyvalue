# EODHD Concept Normalization Reference

This file is the single source of truth for **how each `financial_facts` concept is
normalized from a raw EODHD `fundamentals_raw` payload** — for every concept, where its
value comes from in the JSON, and how its `end_date`, `fiscal_period`, `currency`, and
`unit_kind` are decided, plus the fallbacks and the checks that make the normalizer skip or
rescale a value.

It complements two existing docs and does not repeat them:

- [Normalization and Facts](../architecture/normalization-and-facts.md) — the provider-agnostic
  concept model and *why* metrics read from facts.
- [`financial_facts` table](../architecture/database/tables/financial_facts.md) — the schema,
  constraints, and migration history of the destination table.

Source of truth in code: `src/pyvalue/normalization/eodhd.py` (the
`EODHDFactsNormalizer`) and `src/pyvalue/currency.py`. Worked examples below are real,
pruned payloads for **MSFT**, **GOOGL**, and **ADBE** pulled from `fundamentals_raw`.

> EODHD is the only provider, so every distinct `concept` in `financial_facts` came from
> this normalizer. The authoritative concept set is therefore whatever
> `SELECT DISTINCT concept FROM financial_facts` returns — **46 concepts** as of
> 2026-07-03 (the full supported universe is normalized locally).

## Normalized fact shape

A fact row is `(listing_id, concept, fiscal_period, end_date, unit_kind, value, filed,
currency)`. Two invariants matter throughout this doc (enforced by the schema — see the
table doc):

- `fiscal_period` ∈ `FY`, `Q1`–`Q4`, `TTM`, `INSTANT`.
- `unit_kind` ∈ `monetary`, `per_share`, `ratio`, `percent`, `multiple`, `count`, `other`;
  and `currency` is **non-NULL iff `unit_kind` is `monetary` or `per_share`**, NULL
  otherwise. `currency` is always a *major* unit (no `GBX`/`ZAC`/`ILA`).

## Payload sections that are read (everything else is ignored)

| Section | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| `General.CurrencyCode` | payload-level currency fallback (precedence step 3) |
| `General.UpdatedAt` | `end_date` for snapshot facts (TTM DPS, INSTANT shares) |
| `Highlights.DividendShare` | `CommonStockDividendsPerShareCashPaid` (TTM) |
| `Highlights.MarketCapitalization` | `ProviderMarketCapitalization` (INSTANT) |
| `SharesStats.SharesOutstanding` / `.SharesFloat` | `CommonStockSharesOutstanding` (INSTANT) |
| `outstandingShares.{annual,quarterly}` | `CommonStockSharesOutstanding` (FY / Qn) |
| `Earnings.{History,Annual}` | `EarningsPerShareDiluted` (`epsActual`) |
| `Financials.{Balance_Sheet,Income_Statement,Cash_Flow}.{yearly,quarterly}` | all statement concepts |

Ignored sections include `Technicals`, `AnalystRatings`, `Holders`, `InsiderTransactions`,
`ESGScores`, `SplitsDividends`, and any statement line-item not listed in the per-family
tables below.

## Cross-cutting rules (apply to every concept)

1. **Value coercion** — `_to_float`; a non-numeric/absent value yields `None` and the fact
   is skipped.
2. **`end_date`** — `_extract_date` reads the entry's `date` (then `Date`, then `period`) and
   truncates to `YYYY-MM-DD`; an unparseable date skips the entry. Snapshot facts instead use
   `General.UpdatedAt` (see those families).
3. **`fiscal_period`** — `_infer_quarter`: an explicit `period` of `Q1`–`Q4` is honored,
   otherwise it is derived from the **calendar month** of `end_date` (`≤03→Q1`, `≤06→Q2`,
   `≤09→Q3`, else `Q4`); the `yearly` bucket is `FY`. ⚠ This is the *calendar* month, not the
   issuer's fiscal quarter — see [Caveats](#known-subtleties--caveats).
4. **Currency precedence** — `resolve_eodhd_currency`, in order:
   1. entry-level `currency` / `currency_symbol` / `CurrencyCode`;
   2. statement-level `currency_symbol` / `currency` / `CurrencyCode`;
   3. payload-level `General.CurrencyCode`;
   4. an optional caller-supplied fallback (used only by the snapshot families).
   There is no silent default.
5. **Missing currency on a monetary/`per_share` fact** → a structured warning
   (`warn_missing_monetary_currency`) and the fact is **dropped** (the schema forbids a
   currency-less monetary row).
6. **Subunit scaling** — `normalize_monetary_amount` collapses configured subunits to their
   base currency and divides the amount: `GBX`/`GBP0.01`→`GBP`, `ZAC`→`ZAR`, `ILA`→`ILS`,
   each `÷100`. A stored fact never holds a subunit code.
7. **Listing-currency FX alignment (optional)** — when a `target_currency` is supplied,
   `_convert_facts_to_target_currency` converts monetary/`per_share` facts to
   `base(listing.currency)`; counts/ratios pass through. Missing FX **skips that one fact**
   (`raise_on_missing_fx=False`). Derived same-period conversions use the same skip-on-missing
   behavior; see [Normalization and Facts](../architecture/normalization-and-facts.md) for the
   broader FX policy.

Four concepts are mapped in code but **not present** in the live table — see
[Mapped but unpopulated](#mapped-but-currently-unpopulated).

## Statement families

All three statement families share the same header rules; only the leaf field(s) differ.

**Shared rules for `Financials.<Statement>`:**

- **Section / periods:** both `.yearly` and `.quarterly` are present, each a dict keyed by the
  period end-date. Value path: `Financials.<Statement>.<yearly|quarterly>[<end_date>].<leaf>`
  (each leaf tried in order; lookup is case-insensitive).
- **`end_date`:** the entry's own `date` (equals the dict key) — *per-entry*, never top-level.
- **`fiscal_period`:** `FY` for `yearly`; calendar-month-inferred `Qn` for `quarterly`.
- **`currency`:** entry `currency_symbol` → statement `currency_symbol` → `General.CurrencyCode`.
- **`unit_kind`:** `monetary`, except the share-count concepts (`count`, currency NULL).

### Balance Sheet — `Financials.Balance_Sheet`

| Concept | leaf field(s) tried | unit_kind | Fallback / skip·scale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AssetsCurrent | `totalCurrentAssets` | monetary | else `totalAssets − nonCurrentAssetsTotal` (if ≥0); else Σ(`cashAndShortTermInvestments` **or** `shortTermInvestments`+arbitrated cash (see note below), `netReceivables`, `inventory`, `otherCurrentAssets`) |
| LiabilitiesCurrent | `totalCurrentLiabilities` | monetary | else `totalLiab − nonCurrentLiabilitiesTotal` (if ≥0); else Σ(`accountsPayable`, `otherCurrentLiab`, `currentDeferredRevenue`, `shortTermDebt` **or** `shortLongTermDebt`) |
| Assets | `totalAssets` | monetary | — |
| Liabilities | `totalLiabilities`, `totalLiab` | monetary | — |
| StockholdersEquity | `totalStockholderEquity`, `totalShareholderEquity` | monetary | also derived (see Derived) |

| EntityCommonStockSharesOutstanding | `shareIssued`, `commonStockSharesOutstanding` | count | currency NULL |
| CommonStockSharesOutstanding | `shareIssued`, `commonStockSharesOutstanding` | count | currency NULL; also from snapshot + historical + alias; share-record collapse dedups |

> **`cash` vs `cashAndEquivalents`.** Neither raw field is trustworthy on its own — EODHD
> swaps which one carries the filing's "cash and cash equivalents" by era, even within a
> single payload. TSLA 2023+ holds the headline figure in `cash` (FY2025 16.51B) and a
> narrow sub-line in `cashAndEquivalents` (1.89B); AMD FY2020–22 is the exact inverse
> (`cash` holds the *prior* period's balance, `cashAndEquivalents` the true one). When both
> are present and disagree, `_resolve_cash_and_equivalents` picks the candidate satisfying
> the provider's own rollup identity `candidate + shortTermInvestments ==
> cashAndShortTermInvestments` (1% relative tolerance — real matches are exact to the unit,
> artifacts sit 10%+ away). Without a rollup to test against, or when neither candidate
> satisfies it, `cash` wins: it is populated for ~99.8% of entries and won every
> identity-checkable recent divergence (full-history random sample, 2026-07: ~85% of rows
> are `cash`-only, ~0.9% divergent-with-`cash`-correct, ~0.4% divergent-with-
> `cashAndEquivalents`-correct). The `AssetsCurrent` component-sum fallback consumes the
> same arbitrated value.

### Income Statement — `Financials.Income_Statement`

| EarningsPerShare | *(alias)* | per_share | diluted preferred, else basic (see Derived) |

> **EPS and weighted-average shares are not in the EODHD statement entries.** Verified on

### Cash Flow — `Financials.Cash_Flow`

| Concept | leaf field(s) tried | Fallback / skip·scale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NetCashProvidedByUsedInOperatingActivities | `totalCashFromOperatingActivities` | else `freeCashFlow + capitalExpenditures` |

| StockBasedCompensation | `stockBasedCompensation` | — |
| SalePurchaseOfStock | `salePurchaseOfStock` | — |
| IssuanceOfCapitalStock | `issuanceOfCapitalStock` | — |

## Snapshot families

These are point-in-time facts dated by `General.UpdatedAt` (EODHD's own refresh date), **not**
by a fiscal quarter.

### Dividends per share — `Highlights.DividendShare`

Scalar. Concept `CommonStockDividendsPerShareCashPaid`, `fiscal_period = TTM`,
`unit_kind = per_share`, `end_date = General.UpdatedAt`. Currency =
`resolve_eodhd_currency(Highlights, payload = General.CurrencyCode)`. Skipped if missing
(e.g. ADBE's `DividendShare` is `null` → no fact).

### Provider market capitalization — `Highlights.MarketCapitalization`

Monetary. Concept `ProviderMarketCapitalization`, `fiscal_period = INSTANT`,
`end_date = General.UpdatedAt`. Skipped when missing, non-numeric, or `<= 0`
(placeholders), and when `UpdatedAt` is absent. **Currency code is collapsed
(GBX → GBP, ZAC → ZAR) but the amount is NOT divided by the subunit divisor** —
unlike every statement figure, EODHD quotes this field in major units even when
`General.CurrencyCode` is a subunit code (verified against stored GBX/ZAC
payloads, which factorize as close × shares at ratio ~1.0, not ~0.01).

This fact is **arbitration evidence only**, never a metric output: EODHD
computes it as last close × the *company-total* share count, making it the one
issuer-level total in the payload. The share-count resolver
(`pyvalue.metrics.share_resolver`) divides it by the stored close nearest its
own date to decide whether the SharesStats snapshot or the filing-based
periodic rows carry the real total (see Shares below). pyvalue's `market_cap`
metric remains locally computed (resolved shares × latest price).

## Shares

Concept `CommonStockSharesOutstanding`, `unit_kind = count`, currency NULL, from up to three
sources; the share-record collapse keeps one best record per `(concept, end_date,
fiscal_period)`, preferring `unit_kind = count` and NULL currency.

- **INSTANT snapshot** — `SharesStats.SharesOutstanding` (fallback `SharesStats.SharesFloat`);
  `end_date = General.UpdatedAt`; skipped if `UpdatedAt` missing.
- **Historical** — `outstandingShares.<annual|quarterly>[<i>].shares` (fallback
  `sharesMln × 1e6`); `end_date = dateFormatted` (else `date`; a bare 4-digit year →
  `YYYY-12-31`); `FY` for the annual bucket, calendar-inferred `Qn` for quarterly. The annual
  entries are dated by `dateFormatted` (calendar `12-31`), which can differ from the
  balance-sheet fiscal year-end.
- **Balance sheet** — `EntityCommonStockSharesOutstanding` (above), aliased to
  `CommonStockSharesOutstanding`.

**No single source is the company total for every issuer.** The INSTANT
snapshot counts only the listed ticker's class for dual-class issuers (GOOGL:
5.82B Class A vs the 12.23B total; PLTR similarly), while the filing-based
periodic rows are weighted-average (TSLA) or issued-incl-treasury (Citi)
figures for others. Metrics therefore never read a share concept latest-first
directly: the shared resolver (`pyvalue.metrics.share_resolver`) arbitrates
snapshot vs periodic using `ProviderMarketCapitalization` ÷ the close nearest
its date as the implied company total, and every share-basis metric
(market cap, EV family, P/B, P/TB, Graham multiplier) consumes its choice.
FY-history consumers (Piotroski F7, share-count CAGRs) keep reading the
filing-based series directly.

### Earnings EPS — `Earnings.{History,Annual}`

Concept `EarningsPerShareDiluted`, `unit_kind = per_share`. Value = entry `epsActual`;
`end_date` = entry `date` (or the key); `fiscal_period` inferred (`History` → `Qn`, `Annual`
→ `FY`). Currency = entry `currency` → most-recent non-null earnings currency → statement →
`General.CurrencyCode`.

Three consistency mechanisms:

- **Unreported-quarter placeholder filter** (`History` only, applied before every EPS path) —
  EODHD pre-fills the next, not-yet-reported quarter with a literal `epsActual: 0` (only
  sometimes `null`), and the zero can linger when the actual is never ingested. A `History`
  entry is dropped when **either** its `reportDate` post-dates `General.UpdatedAt` (the actual
  cannot exist before its report, whatever value sits there), **or** `epsActual == 0.0` and the
  period has no quarterly-statement companion (`netIncome` or statement EPS at the same date).
  A genuinely filed breakeven quarter carries its financials in the same payload and survives.
  Null `epsActual` is skipped by the emission paths as before; `Annual` carries no placeholders
  (nor `reportDate` fields) and is not filtered. Without this filter the placeholder anchored
  `eps_ttm`'s TTM window — 2026-07 audit P4, GOOGL 8.00 vs true 10.81.
- **Subunit unit-flip detection** (only when the base currency is a subunit family such as
  GBX/ZAC/ILA): the EPS series is scanned for a jump between consecutive values whose ratio is
  in `[40, 140]×` (`EPS_UNIT_FLIP_RATIO_MIN/MAX`); values below `0.05` are ignored. The
  larger-magnitude cluster is treated as the subunit denomination and rescaled `×0.01`.
- **Implied-EPS fallback** — when neither the Earnings block nor the statement supplies EPS for
  a period, EPS = `NetIncomeLoss / weighted-or-outstanding shares`, matching shares on the same
  date or the nearest within `120` days (quarterly) / `370` days (annual). The implied series
  also calibrates the unit-flip scale (median ratio in `[40,140]×` ⇒ `×0.01`).

## Derived concepts

Computed after the raw pass from already-normalized facts; monetary inputs in different
currencies are converted with `choose_target_currency` + `convert_money_value` (missing FX
skips the period). Only `CommonStockholdersEquity` is an *override* (it removes the
same-period raw read); the rest are additive/alias.

| Concept | Derivation |
| --- | --- |
| EarningsPerShare | alias of `EarningsPerShareDiluted`, else `EarningsPerShareBasic` |
| StockholdersEquity | `Assets − Liabilities` (if ≥0); else alias of `CommonStockholdersEquity` |
| CommonStockholdersEquity (override) | `StockholdersEquity − PreferredStock − NoncontrollingInterestInConsolidatedEntity` |
| IntangibleAssetsNetExcludingGoodwill | `IntangibleAssetsNet`; else `(Assets − Liabilities) − NetTangibleAssets − Goodwill` (if ≥0) |
| NetIncomeLossAvailableToCommonStockholdersBasic | `NetIncomeLoss − PreferredStockDividendsAndOtherAdjustments` |
| CommonStockSharesOutstanding | alias of `EntityCommonStockSharesOutstanding` |

A second tier of alias hooks exists for `NetCashProvidedByUsedInOperatingActivities`,
`CapitalExpenditures`, `OperatingIncomeLoss`, and `PropertyPlantAndEquipmentNet`, but their
fallback concept lists are currently empty, so they are no-ops today.

## Mapped but currently unpopulated

These concepts are defined in `EODHD_STATEMENT_FIELDS` but have **0 rows** in the live table,
because their source keys are absent from the EODHD payloads (verified on MSFT/GOOGL/ADBE):

| Concept | Intended unit_kind | Why absent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| EarningsPerShareBasic | per_share | statement `eps`/`epsBasic` keys not present; the Earnings block emits only diluted |
| WeightedAverageNumberOfDilutedSharesOutstanding | count | `weightedAverageShsOutDil*` not present in statement entries |
| WeightedAverageNumberOfSharesOutstandingBasic | count | `weightedAverageShsOut*` not present in statement entries |
| PreferredStockDividendsAndOtherAdjustments | monetary | `preferredStockAndOtherAdjustments` is `null` for sampled issuers |

This is the data EODHD currently returns, not necessarily a permanent state; if a future
payload carries these keys the normalizer will emit the concepts. (The live DB also predates
some of these mappings; re-normalization would confirm.)

## Worked examples (real pruned payloads)

The blocks below are the actual `fundamentals_raw` payloads for each ticker, **pruned to only
the sections/fields the normalizer reads**, with `// →` annotations added (so they are not
literal JSON). The three are USD reporters; the instructive difference is the fiscal year-end,
which drives quarter labeling.

Note MSFT exposes three different share counts at three different dates: `SharesStats`
7,425,629,076 (INSTANT @ 2026-03-29), balance-sheet `commonStockSharesOutstanding`
7,465,000,000 (FY @ 2025-06-30), and `outstandingShares` 7,460,000,000 (FY @ 2025-12-31).

### Subunit scaling (illustrative — not one of the three)

A UK statement entry with `"currency_symbol": "GBX"` and `"totalRevenue": 500` stores
`value = 5.00`, `currency = "GBP"` — the `÷100` subunit collapse guards against mixing pence
and pounds.

## Known subtleties / caveats

- **`PreferredStock` excludes `capitalStock` (fixed).** The leaf chain is genuine
  preferred-equity fields only. `capitalStock` was previously a fallback, but for issuers
  without preferred stock it is common stock + additional paid-in capital; because the override
  `CommonStockholdersEquity = StockholdersEquity − PreferredStock − NCI`, that mislabel drove
  common equity **negative** (AAPL FY2025: `PreferredStock` 93.6B → `CommonStockholdersEquity`
  −19.8B, negative every year 2022–2025). The `capitalStock` fallback was removed, so with no
  real preferred field present no `PreferredStock` fact is emitted and common equity is no
  longer understated. Already-stored rows reflect the fix only after the cached payloads are
  re-normalized.
- **Calendar-month, not fiscal, quarter labels.** `fiscal_period` for quarterly rows is derived
  from the calendar month of `end_date`. Verified on AAPL (fiscal year-end Sep 30): the
  September-ending quarter is stored as `Q3` (month map `03→Q1, 06→Q2, 09→Q3, 12→Q4`), so a
  company's fiscal Q-number need not match the stored label.
- **EPS comes from the `Earnings` block, not the income statement** (statement `eps*` keys are
  absent from EODHD payloads — see the Income Statement note).
- **Snapshot facts are dated by `General.UpdatedAt`**, independent of the latest filed quarter.
- **One concept, several sources.** `CommonStockSharesOutstanding` is produced by the balance
  sheet, `SharesStats`, and `outstandingShares` at potentially different dates; the share-record
  collapse keeps one per `(concept, end_date, fiscal_period)`. The `SharesStats` INSTANT row is
  **per ticker class** for dual-class issuers, so the newest row of this concept is not
  necessarily the company total — consumers go through the share resolver (see Shares).
- **Stored `currency` is always a major unit**; subunits are collapsed before a fact is built.
