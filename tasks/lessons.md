## Lessons

- Date: 2026-03-22
- User correction: `pyvalue report-ingest-progress` crashed after a quota helper signature change.
- Recurring pattern: Generalizing a shared helper without explicitly verifying every runtime call site can leave one CLI path behind even when related tests look adequate.
- Preventive rule: After changing a shared helper signature, grep all call sites, run the affected CLI commands directly in the target conda env, and add or keep a regression test that exercises each public command path using that helper.
- Resulting action: Recorded the rule here and rechecked the helper call sites plus the `report-ingest-progress` command path in the `pyvalue` env.

- User correction: Market-data and fundamentals quota behavior for the user's EODHD account did not match the assumption I inferred from prior implementation reasoning.
- Recurring pattern: Treating provider quota semantics as settled without reconciling account-specific user feedback against the public API contract can lead to confident but incomplete explanations.
- Preventive rule: When quota or billing behavior affects execution decisions, verify both the official provider docs and the actual API fields available in the integration path, and clearly separate documented shared limits from any account-specific behavior reported by the user.
- Resulting action: Recorded the distinction here and rechecked the public EODHD API Limits and User API docs before answering.

- Date: 2026-03-22
- User correction: Even with separate paid EODHD products, the practical daily limit for this setup is shared between fundamentals and market-data requests.
- Recurring pattern: Reading plan/product wording too literally can lead to the wrong quota model if actual usage accounting still rolls up into one shared daily counter.
- Preventive rule: For provider quota logic, prefer the authoritative runtime counter used by the integration path over marketing/billing wording unless the API exposes separate counters that can actually be enforced in code.
- Resulting action: Corrected the lesson to treat EODHD's current integration as a shared daily-budget model until distinct quota fields are available in the API response.
